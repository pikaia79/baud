# The Architecture of BAUD

BaudEngine is a multi-model distributed database.

## Features

* the best of SQL and NoSQL in one system

* dynamic schema

* unlimited scalability

* cloud-native

* flexible deployment configuration

## Data Model

Field, Object, Space, DB

* Object (Document)

OID (primary key) -> fields

OID can be specified by applications or generated by the system

* Field

Field: key -> a scalar value, an array of values, or a nested structure

Any field can be indexed and morever full-text search is a first-class citizen. 

Formally, a field is defined as (name, value, property) where property = (dataType, indexType, analyzer).

* Field Datatypes

string, numberic, date, boolen, binary

array, object

Geo-point, geo-shape

* Analysis

text -> term

* Routing

hash of the routing key

document -> partition

* Mapping

Each space has a 'mapping' to specify the field types, how to index, analyzer etc.

Usually a scalar field is defined as the primary key and a scalar field as the routing key. And they can be same.

* Dynamic Mapping

The mappings are not only defined explicitly, but can be generated automatically, i.e. you can add new fields on the insert time.

* Graph

Native support for the SPO model

Edges as a special kind of fields: predicates as keys, and an array of "space/oid" as values


## System Concepts

BaudEngine is a multi-datacenter distributed system. However, it can be run in the single-datacenter mode.  

### zone

Zones, or called cells, are the unit of physical isolation as well as admin deployment. 

### components

* Master

the global master of the entire cluster

the zone master per zone

both are based on raft replication for high availability

* Partition Server

host one or mulitple partitions of three roles: leader, sync replica, async replica

* Gateway Servers

MyGate - the NewSQL gateway with MySQL-compatible protocol

Router - the NoSQL gateway with ElasticSearch-compatible protocol

### software stack

* cluster management

conainer-native - run in Kubernetes, or on bare metal. 

each zone has a DCOS/Kubernetes interface to allocate PS nodes and router nodes. 

each DB is allocated with its own set of PS across different zones.

* BaudStorage

As the shared datacenter storage, BS can be mounted to store partition data, which is log-structured sorted key-value files and redo-logs (WALs). 

Note BaudEngine can also run on local filesystems - actually BS is transparent to BE. 

### partitioning 

db -> space -> partition = partition key hash range

The partition count is planned according to the maximum write throughput that the space should provision. 

### replication

raft, async, and partial

Each partition has a Raft state machine located in three partitionservers of different zones, running the 'multi-raft' protocol. 

Moreover, a partition can several read-only replicas, which pull the raft log asynchronously. 

### scalability

* goal

One Baud cluster can host one to thousands of databases; 
one DB can host billions of spaces;
one space can host unlimited number of objects;

* scaling up/down - resizing partitions

Moving partitions between PS nodes for load balancing is easy by leveraging the BaudStorage DCFS: stop a partition replica and restart from another partitionserver.

* scaling out/in - online re-sharding

Partition splitting & merging is implemented via the partial replication (filtered or merged). 

However, we recommand that a space is pre-sharded and somehow over-sharded to avoid re-sharding on runtime.


### local index vs. global index

currently local index only. 


### distributed transactions across partitions

the intent-based protocol: 

1, a space for trx records with UUID as keys

2, write intents for fields


## Master

There are two tiers for the cluster topo metadata managment. 

### globalmaster

* core data structures

db and space schemas

zones

partitions -> zones

note that the globalmaster has no knowledge of nodes, neither PS nodes nor router nodes

* key operations

create DB and Spaces

split or merge a partition

### zonemaster

* core data structures

partitions -> PS nodes

* key operations

assign partitions to PS nodes

* failure detector (FD)

distributed voting of PS health

* placement driver (PD)


## PartitionServer

### storage engine

Each partition has a storage engine for storing and indexing its objects. 

And the underlying storage engine should be log-structured so as to be persisted to the Baudstorage distributed filesystem. 

There are two pluggable storage engines: blevesearch, and kernel. 

* batch operations

multiple writes grouped into one batch within a partition

### replication engine

* multi-raft

* async replication

### execution engine


### change streaming

each individual change record contains the change type (insert/update/delete) and the pre and post-image of the fields modified. 

## Partition Splitting and Merging

## Distributed Transaction

## Router

### query language

Router extends elasticsearch DSL: 

* Graph


## MyGate

MySQL driver --> MyGate

### data model mapping

table vs space

space = tables sharing the same partitioning key


row vs object

object fields = row fields + the field of 'tableid'


compound indexes

multiple columns form a new field


### schema management

There is a 'system' DB on BaudEngine.

### SQL parsing, planning, and executing


## Manageability

### Deployment Flexibility

* single zone or multiple zones

* the BaudStorage datacenter filesystem or local filesystems

* raft-based write replication and/or storage-shared read replication

* Kubernetes or bare metal

### Backup and Restore

provide a point-in-time snapshot of the data on a partition

### Monitoring

cluster-level statistics

space-level info

individual nodes

GC

SlowLog

### Ops Center


## Search

vector space model (VSM) as the ranking model

## Graph

Baudengine is a native graph database - all edges are stored together with vertices (i.e. documents).
